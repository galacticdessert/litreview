* Introduction to the problem
On-road vehicles, which convert around one third of the fuel energy into useful mechanical energy for propulsion, are moving energy conversion systems that generate considerable waste heat. Due to the inefficiency of the internal combustion engine, around 60-70% of the fuel energy is wasted in the form of heat. Caton indicates that approximately 40% of the fuel energy leaves the engine in the hot exhaust and another another 30% is lost as heat. Thermodynamic energy and exergy analysis reveals that the largest losses from these engines are due to combustion irreversibility and heat loss to the coolant, through the exhaust, and by direct convection and radiation to the environment. Combustion irreversibility results in a loss of approximately 20-30% of the fuel exergy (or work potential) which cannot be recovered but may be reduced through use of fuels with less-complex molecular structures such as hydrogen.In theory, radiant and convective heat loss to the environment can be reduced through better insulation and use of advanced materials with lower thermal conductivities, and heat loss to the coolant and oil can be reduced by operating with these fluids at higher temperatures. However, achieving these results in practice is technically challenging and may require further advances in material sciences. Also, these reductions typically result in increased exhaust energy rather than directly increasing brake work from the cylinders. The best option for achieving significant improvements in efficiency appears to be recovery of waste heat from the exhaust and/or other high-energy streams through turbo- compounding, thermo-electrics, or bottoming cycles. Regardless of how efficient the engine is, there will still be a significant fraction of the fuel energy that is rejected in the exhaust and coolant streams. Unfortunately, much of the heat transfer either occurs at relatively low temperatures resulting in large entropy generation (such as in the air-charge cooler), is transferred to low-exergy flow streams (such as the oil and engine coolant), or is radiated or convected directly to the environment.

Rankine cycle has a great potential to be applied to harvest waste heat from automobiles. However, different from other low-grade waste heat sources, vehicles have limited space for the RC system integration and the waste heat is relatively unstable.

It has been estimated that the thermal efficiency of a modern IC engine is limited to 20-40% while 33% of the fuel energy from a typical medium-size passenger vehicle is carried away by exhaust gases and 29% is carried away by engine cooling water in urban traffic conditions. Depending on engine type and operating conditions, the IC exhaust gas temperature usually varies from 500 to 900 °C and engine cooling water temperature is around 100 °C.

Engine coolant and exhaust gas are two main heat sources in a vehicle, which carry a similar amount of thermal energy. However, exhaust gas shows a much greater recovery potential in terms of exergy because of a much higher temperature range. For this reason, recover heat from the two sources using the same loop and same working fluid might not be appropriate due to the potential mismatch between fluid properties and heat sources temperature ranges. The waste heat from the engine could be harvested either by pumping the working fluid through the engine block or using a separate loop and different working fluids.

* Possible Solutions
** Organic Rankine Cycle
Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), which uses an organic fluid with a low boiling point working medium, is considered as the most promising technology to recover energy from low-grade waste heat.

The RC system is an interesting system to harvest part of the wasted energy. An RC system is made of four main components:
- Evaporator
- Expander
- Condenser
- Pump

The waste heat is used in the evaporator to vaporize the working fluid and convert the heat in mechanical work in the expander. Extensive work has been poured in RC + ICE combinations, leading to fuel saving in the order of 10 - 15% when applied to truck diesel engines.

RC are system widely adopted in a large range of WHR situations, however heat sources on vehicles are different from other typical industrial heat sources, which are stable and no space limitation for the RC system. To be technically feasible for vehicle RC application, the cycle system should be kept as simple as possible and utilize components that already exist in the vehicles in order to reduce the added expense, weight and complexity of the system. Besides, the temperature ranges of the two main heat sources on vehicles are significantly different which requires special treatment.

*** Possible configurations - generation of mechanical power

*[INSERISCI FIGURE DA TOYOTA]*

The most common and simple structure utilizes the exhaust gas as the only heat source to evaporate the working fluid. The second structure adds another heat exchanger (recuperator) before the evaporator, using the steam from the expander to preheat the working fluid. A third structure uses waste heat from engine coolant to preheat the working fluid. The regenerative preheating of structure 2 requires a very complex liquid-gas heat exchanger with high exchange surfaces, while the preheater in structure 3 only requires a simple liquid-liquid heat exchanger.

There have been contradicting conclusions about the effect of preheating using engine coolant on the RC system efficiency. Based on Vaja and Gambarotta’s work, the RC system with a preheater allows a net increase in power output, compared to structure 1, of 10% to 35%, depending on which working fluid is chosen. Alberto Boretti also showed a 8.2% fuel economy improvement using engine coolant to preheat the RC cycle, compared to a 6.4% improvement when only exhaust gas is used to boil the working fluid. Arias et al. also compared the combined exhaust and engine coolant heat recovery system with the exhaust only structure. It was found that the additional power recovered from the engine coolant system was 20W out of a total 2140W, which is around 1% improvement.

It was argued that the reason why it is not advantageous to build combined engine coolant and exhaust gas waste heat recovery system is due to the constraint imposed on the engine coolant temperature, around 100 °C, is not a good match for the working fluid preheating. Duparchy et al. also analyzed the waste heat recovery potential for engine cooling water and exhaust gas from both energy and exergy points of view. It was found that the proportion of thermal energy carried by exhaust gas is comparable with that dissipated by engine cooling water, which means these two sources are roughly equivalent from the energy point of view. However, exhaust gas shows a much greater recovery potential in terms of exergy. The main reason why opposite conclusions were drawn from different studies is that different working fluid is selected for the RC system. For organic fluids, the preheating energy ranges 30% to 50% of the total obtained energy while it is only about 10% for water.

There are two additional configurations possible for WHR. Instead of using engine coolant to preheat the working  uid, the engine block, which has higher temperature, is used to partially evaporate the working fluid. For this structure, complete evaporation of the working  uid inside the engine block should be prevented. It should reach intermediate boiling in the engine block, so that two-phase mixture would flow out of the engine block and into the evaporator to complete the boiling and superheating process by exhaust gas. The second option is to build separate system loops and use different working fluids to match the speci c characteristics of engine coolant and exhaust gas. This system has been developed by BMW, in which waster was used as the medium in the high-temperature (HT) loop and ethanol as working fluid in the low-temperature (LT) loop. The dual loop system can utilize the full potential of the waste energy with the disadvantage of large system volume and system complexity. Another RC system which integrated with engine cooling, this system minimized the number of required components by adopting an evaporative engine cooling structure and a refrigerant as the working fluid, so that the engine functioned as an evaporator and the existing radiator worked as a condenser. The only extra component added to the system is an expander for power conversion. However, this structure requires a modification of the existing engine cooling system, while the current engine cooling technology is quite mature and widely taken and has been using 50/50 water ethylene glycol as the coolant for decades.

When selecting the different configurations, different factors have to be take into consideration as the maximization of the recovered energy is not the only objective to pursue. System complexity, component volume and weight, and the resulted extra cost added to the vehicles and the payback period are also big concerns.

**** Dual-loop systems (University of Glasgow)
A dual-loop ORC is presented to simultaneously recover energy from both the exhaust gases and the coolant of a petrol engine. A high-temperature (HT) ORC loop is used to recover heat from the exhaust gases, while a low-temperature (LT) ORC loop is used to recover heat from the coolant and the condensation heat of the HT loop.
The results show that the dual-loop ORC can effectively recover the waste heat from the petrol engine, as reported in the table:

| Regime         | Thermal efficiency increase |
|----------------+-----------------------------|
| high - speed   | 20 - 24 %                   |
| medium - speed | 14 - 20 %                   |
| low - speed    | 30 %                        |

Because the temperatures and thermodynamic properties of the exhaust and coolant from an internal combustion engine differ a lot, it is impossible to find a simple ORC architecture to complete heat recovery of these two kinds of waste heat simultaneously. Many different ORC systems were proposed for engine waste recovery. Currently, a dual-loop cycle designed by BMW has caused the greatest attention. Freymann et al, 2008, employed water and ethanol as the working fluids for BMW’s schematic. Because both water and ethanol are wet fluids, large irreversibility will be produced during the heat transfer processes.
Wang et al, 2012, Zhang et al, 2013, and Yang et al, 2014, proposed a dual-loop ORC system using R245fa and R134a as working fluids and estimated their energy saving potential for gasoline and diesel engines, respectively. Meanwhile, Shu et al, 2014, Song and Gu, 2015, studied the performances of dual-loop ORCs using different working fluids.

[INSERIRE SCHEMATICO DEL CICLO A DOPPIO LOOP E DIAGRAMMA T-S]

The thermal efficiency of the HT loop with R1233zd is slightly higher than that of the R245fa. On the other hand, the thermal efficiencies of the LT loop using R1234yf are slighter lower than those of the R134a under all the ambient temperatures. As a result, the thermodynamic performance of the dual-loop ORC with R1233zd and R1234yf is slightly higher than that with R245fa and R134a. However, the dual-loop ORC with R1233zd and R1234yf has better environmental performance and thus more suitable for engine waste heat recovery.

**** WHR for light duty diesel engines (Thomas Briggs etc.)
Lab demonstration was designed to maximize the peak brake thermal efficiency of the engine, and the combined system achieved an efficiency of 45%. A modern automotive diesel engine can easily achieve a 42% brake thermal efficiency at its optimum operating point.
In order for the engine-out NOx emission to be ≤ 1.0 g/bhp-hr, the 2007/2010 heavy-duty diesel engines have to be operated with a high EGR rate and the delayed combustion. These engine operation conditions result in penalties in the engine efficiency and the fuel economy: increased exhaust temperatures were observed from engines operated with such an emissions-reduction strategy. The high exhaust temperature indicates that the engine exhaust is with a high energy level. DPF needs to be regenerated periodically by burning up the loaded carbon particles, which boosts the exhaust energy level.

The high load factor of heavy-duty engines was deemed a more appropriate match to bottoming cycles. However, in recent years there has been an increased emphasis on light-duty vehicle efficiency as well.

The organic Rankine cycle system was installed on a General Motors 1.9-liter diesel engine. The high exhaust temperature drove the selection of exhaust heat as the energy source for the ORC. Since the ORC impacts the backpressure on the engine and therefore its performance it is necessary to analyze the change in efficiency between the engine-only and engine +ORC operating cases.

Engine operation was not significantly affected by the addition of the ORC heat exchangers to the exhaust system. The backpressure at the turbine exit was increased by 13.8 kPa; this is a similar backpressure increase as a muffler would provide. Past researchers have found that the heat exchangers can replace the muffler in a vehicle, eliminating the additional loss that would otherwise be expected.

As the refrigerant passes through the two-stage evaporator, it is heated first by the post-turbine engine exhaust and then by the high-pressure EGR. Because the EGR is extracted upstream of the turbine and thus is at a significantly higher temperature than the exhaust, this design provides better superheating of the refrigerant and produces a higher net work at the expense of further reducing the exhaust temperature. After leaving the evaporator, the superheated refrigerant is expanded in the turbine to extract work. The ORC turbine includes a bypass line for use during start-up and at conditions where liquid refrigerant would pass through the turbine (which would damage the system). The evaporator effectiveness and refrigerant mass flow rate were found to have the largest impact on ORC system efficiency by limiting the amount of energy transferred to the refrigerant as well as the maximum refrigerant temperature entering the turbine. At low refrigerant mass flow rates, heat transfer to the refrigerant is limited by the evaporator effectiveness when the exit temperature of the refrigerant approaches the inlet temperature of the exhaust and/or EGR. Increasing mass flow rate increases turbine power output but also decreases the temperature of the exhaust and EGR leaving the evaporator until, eventually, heat transfer in the evaporator becomes limited when the exit temperature of the exhaust and/or EGR streams approach the inlet temperature of the refrigerant. At this point, further increases in refrigerant mass flow rate will reduce the temperature and enthalpy at the ORC turbine inlet resulting in lower power output. Thus the only way to improve ORC efficiency is to increase the temperature of the exhaust and/or EGR streams and increase as a consequence the refrigerant temperature and enthalpy entering the ORC turbine. Because the amount of heat transferred to the refrigerant is limited by the evaporator effectiveness, the temperature of the exhaust leaving the evaporator will also increase to the benefit of any downstream aftertreatment devices.

The performance of the ORC system was found to be further limited by the condenser pressure which is determined by the coolant temperature and saturation properties of the refrigerant. At 100°C, the saturation pressure for R245fa is approximately 12.5 bar. Due to this high exit pressure and the relatively low amount of energy transferred from the exhaust and EGR, the ORC turbine is unable to extract enough work at low engine loads to overcome the pump requirements.

By recovering energy from the exhaust and EGR cooler, the ORC system increases the overall efficiency by slightly more than 2-3 percentage points.

**** Evaporative engine cooling system
Evaporative engine cooling system is utilized to obtain high thermal efficiency and simplicity of the Rankine bottoming system. There is the possivility for the application of Rankine bottoming system to passenger cars, with an attempt made to combine the evaporative engine cooling system and Rankine bottoming system for the simplification of system.

In case of passenger cars, however, the temperature and calorific value of exhaust gas tend to fluctuate markedly because of frequent repetition of starting and stopping in urban areas, which are different from the running pattern of trucks used for long-distance transportation.

This system tries to simplify the conventional Rankine cycle to make it applicable to passenger cars. an evaporative engine cooling system was used, and an attempt was made to recover the energy by using the vapor which was generated in the engine water jacket. With this new Rankine system, the evaporator normally required in conventional Rankine bottoming system became unnecessary. It will be also able to utilize the space, where installed radiator of conventional engine, for new Rankine system condenser. As for the pumps, the engine coolimg water pump alone was replaced by Rankine bottoming system pump. In other words, the only additional device required of this new system was expander.

The pressure ratio here represents the ratio between the pressure P1 at the expander inlet and the pressure P2 at the outlet. (Namely, Pressure ratio = P1 /P2) It is found from the figure that the greater becomes the pressure ratio or the greater becomes waste heat, the greater becomes the energy recovery. The fuel economy impovement rate under the low load running conditions (vehicle speed: 40 km/h; road gradient: 0 %) was approximately 4.5 % where the pressure ratio was 2.0, and the improvement rate under the same ranning condition was about 7 % where the pressure ratio was 3.0.

According to an experimental setup, paired with a 1.5 liters engine, the maximum energy recovery was 400 [Watt] under the hill-clibming condition, 240 [Watt] under the 40km/h running condition, and 160 [Watt] under the idling condition. While the pressure ratio became higher as the expander revolution became lower, the energy recovery began to drop as the revolution became lower than 800 rpm, due to the drop of expander efficiency. It is found that the energy recovery became lower as the ambient temperature became higher. It was because the pressure on the lower side (P2 , on the condenser side) became higher as the ambient temperature became higher, and the pressure difference between P1 and P2) would not exist unless the pressure on the higher side (P1).

In the experiment conducted in 1993 by Oomori and Ogino, approximately 3% of the engine output energy was recovered at the ambient temperature of 25 °C, though the energy recovery rate varies in line with the ambient temperature.

*** Possible configurations - generation of electrical power
The objective of this project was to investigate energy recovery from an internal combustion engine operating as a supplemental power plant for a hybrid vehicle.
The constant load conditions for the SI-engine in the hybrid vehicle are a potential advantage for the implementation of a heat recovery system. The models indicated that using the engine block as a steam generator and the exhaust as a source for superheating the steam was the most efficient system investigated. Using this system, as much as 7% of the total energy input, or 10% of the total waste heat, could be recovered under an arbitrary city driving load cycle. 

To evaluate the potential energy recovery in a practical hybrid implementation, experimental vehicle data from a Toyota Prius hybrid vehicle were used as inputs for the vehicle/energy recover model. Because the exhaust temperature for this vehicle model was lower than had been assumed in the study to this point, exhaust-only energy recovery proved to be extremely poor, with an average recovery rate of 0.8% of total fuel energy in and about 1.8% of total available waste heat. However, when energy was extracted with the combination of the engine block and exhaust, approximately 5.5% of the total fuel energy and about 7.5% of the total waste heat could be recovered. These numbers compare favorably with the more ideal case described above.

A third system, shown in Figure 5, was proposed to take advantage of both the engine waste heat and the exhaust gases. In this system, the conventional engine coolant system was eliminated and as a replacement, the engine block was used as the evaporator for the Rankine cycle. This strategy has the advantage of using the waste heat from the engine at a higher temperature than the one that would be achievable by using the conventional engine coolant system. In order to prevent the heat transfer fluid from completely evaporating inside the engine block, a design parameter was used to set an intermediate state in the boiling process. It can be seen that approximately 5.5% of the total inlet energy and 7.5% of the total waste heat can be recovered with this arrangement.

The efficiency of split cycle engine is determined by 4 key factors; the compression/expansion ratio, the recuperation effectiveness and the heat release amount from the fuel. This is different from the ideal engine efficiency, which is dominated by the compression ratio alone.

*** Applications to passenger vehicles to date

**** Possible efficiency improvements
Two improvements are mainly used in the literature to asses the impact of RC systems: /thermal efficiency/ and /mechanical efficiency/.
Thermal efficiency is defined as 
\begin{equation}
\eta_{th} = \frac{W_{RC}}{m_{fuel} \cdot LHV}
\end{equation}
while mechanical efficiency is defined as 
\begin{equation}
\eta_{m} = \frac{W_{RC}}{P_{e}}
\end{equation}

Assuming one third of the total fuel energy is transferred to mechanical power output, which is a typical value for modern internal combustion engine, then usually the thermal efficiency is about one third of the mechanical efficiency.

*** Expanders
Critical aspect that has to be chosen carefully. Many factors need to be considered during the process of expander selection for a RC system targeting passenger vehicles, e.g. inlet and outlet working conditions, pressure ratio, power output, working  uid, weight, volume, cost, reliability, isentropic ef ciency, lubrication requirement, complexity, rotational speed, etc. In general, expander can be categorized into two types: velocity type, e.g. axial turbine expander, and volume type, e.g. scroll expander, screw expander and reciprocal piston expander.

**** Turbine expander
A turbine expander is rotary machine that converts the kinetic energy carried by a fluid stream into mechanical energy when it passes through a set of blades. Commercial micro-turbines available but not widely used (Domingues). The reduced mass and overall dimensions made the turbine one of the most appropriate expander for a RC vehicle waste heat recovery application. Due to the lack of commercial micro-turbine expanders, most researchers used their in-house speci cally designed turbine to test their RC system, usually impulse turbines. BMW’s second generation Turbosteamer  adopted a speci cally designed two-stage impulse turbine integrated with an electric generator for their RC system, see Figure 8. The turbine works in the pressure range of 6-10 bar and the rotary speed is about 50,000 to 100,000 rpm. The electrical power output of the unit is about a 2 kW. Compared to a scaled-down reaction turbine which is generally used in power plants, the impulse turbine design signi cantly reduces the  ow leakage. Lubrication free is another advantage of this design compared to volumetric expansion machines.

In general, the advantages of a turbine expander include compact structure, light weight and high ef ciency. However, the design and manufacturing of turbine is very dif cult, which leads to a relatively higher cost and the turbine ef ciency decreases signi cantly under off-design conditions. Besides, a turbine expander puts more constraints to the working  uid selection since a turbine cannot bear two-phase condition. Therefore if the heat addition is variable, the wetness in the expansion process may become uncontrollable and the droplets may damage the turbine blades. Also, a speed reduction gearbox might be required if the turbine outputs the mechanical energy directly to the crank shaft due to the speed mismatch. It is suggested that turbine expanders are preferred to be combined with electrical generators for energy conversion and storage, which make it a practical solution for hybrid vehicles.

It is *more suitable to be combined with electrical generators* for energy conversion.

**** Scroll Expander
Scroll expander is one of the displacement type expanding machines, which are characterized by lower  ow rates, higher pressure ratios and much lower rotational speeds than turbo-machines. Advantages of this kind of technology are compact structure, reliability, fewer moving parts, lower level of noise and vibration. Besides, compare to turbine expander, these displacement type machines can tolerate two-phase conditions, which may difficult to be avoided at the end of the expansion considering the dynamic operating conditions in vehicles.

For RC system with small power output, leakage of the working fluid was the dominant cause of low efficiency of scroll expander. The first RC application to passenger vehicle study from Toyota adopted a scroll expander which had an inlet volume of 40 cc and an expansion ratio of 2. The size of the scroll expander is 120 mm by 190 mm. The maximum expander efficiency reached in the study is approximately 50%. It was found that the expander efficiency decreases as the revolution became lower than 1000 rpm due to the deterioration of sealing at low revolution speed which led to leakage of the working fluid.

**** Screw Expander
This type of expander is composed of a pair of meshing helical rotors, packing within a case with approximately 50 μm clearances. When the rotors rotate, the volume trapped between the rotors and the casing changes, which makes the fluid volume either increase or decrease, depending on the rotational direction. However, micro-scale screw expander (<10 kWe) for vehicle application is hard to be obtained in the current market and few reports from open literature were found for screw expander application to RC system with power output lower than 10 kWe.

In general, screw expander can tolerate two-phase flow and is highly efficient in off-design conditions. However, like other positive displacement devices, the seal is critical to prevent internal leakage. Besides, lubrication is required to avoid direct contact but also achieve a seal between the lobes of the two rotors, which makes it relatively more expensive to fabricate than scroll expanders.

**** Reciprocating piston expander
     Reciprocating machines have a good isentropic efficiency (about 70%) and a good power output/size ratio. Endo et al. from Honda R&D chose volumetric axial piston as the expanding machine for their RC system due to its low operating speed and comparatively  at efficiency characteristics compared to turbine expander. In general, piston expanders show some advantages over other expansion machines, such as larger built-in volume ratio, high achievable operating pressures and temperatures, ability to tolerate two-phase flow and low rotational speeds.
     
*** Working Fluids
Special attention should be paid to the working fluid selection according to the heat source temperature, which has a significant effect on the system thermal and exergetic efficiency. When implementing a RC system to a passenger vehicle is considered, stricter criterion should be adopted for the fluid selection to minimize the harm potential to passengers in case leakages or crashes happen, e.g. low flammability level is a major concern for passenger vehicle application. Therefore, alcohols and hydrocarbons, in spite of their good thermodynamic efficiencies, are arguably not the best candidates. Instead, the refrigerants, which have already been used in automotive AC systems, are usually better options. Generally, according to the slope of the saturation curve, the working fluid can be categorized into three different types, wet fluid, dry fluid and isentropic fluid.

The criterions of a suitable working fluid are:
- high decomposition temperature to withstand hot source
- suitable evaporating temperature for the hot source
- relatively low evaporating pressure to keep the system safe and lower pumping losses
- large specific heat capacity to absorb the waste heat using less amount of working fluid
- Large specific enthalpy drop along the expansion process to output as much power as possible
- Condensing pressure close to ambient pressure to decrease the possibility of negative pressure in the system.
- Dry fluid to minimize the requirement for super-heat and keep the expander safe
- Low toxicity, low flammability and low cost
- Environmental friendly

Most inorganic fluids are wet fluids, but this means that the expansion ends in two-phase region. Water has been used by auto manufacturers like Honda and BMW, but according to Arias et al. when water was selected as the working fluid, the waste heat from the engine coolant wouldn’t be effectively recovered by the system due to the mismatch between the low temperature of engine coolant and high boiling temperature of water. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that water is a preferable working fluid for high exhaust gas temperature ranging from 500 to 800 °C.

*[INSERIRE GRAFICO DEI FLUIDI CON LE DIFFERENZA, CARINO DA TOYOTA]*

There are a few disadvantages of water, such as the requirement for superheating to avoid turbine blade erosion if turbine is selected to be the expander, but the high degree of superheating makes it less practical for automotive application due to the variation of exhaust temperature at different load conditions. Besides, its high freezing point (0°C) cannot meet the standard automotive working temperature range (-40 ∼ 85°C).

The dry/isentropic refrigerants are widely used in small-scale RC applications because of their good heat transfer properties, excellent thermal stability and low viscosity. They are generally non-flammable, which is a big advantage for automotive application and compatible with most materials. Under typical low temperature ambient conditions they do not freeze, which is a major concern with water. Chammas and Clodic compared different organic fluids with water for RC application to hybrid vehicles and argued that using water for RC system to recover automotive waste heat could lead to a complex system requiring large size equipment and high investment cost, which makes the study on organic working fluid necessary.

Domingues et al. compared R123 and R245fa with water as working fluid for vehicle RC waste heat recovery potential from exhaust gas. The study revealed the advantage of using water as RC working fluid to recover waste heat from exhaust gas of vehicles equipped with spark-ignition engine. However, it was also found that the heat exchanger effectiveness for R123 and R245fa is higher than that for water, and consequently when the exhasut temperature is relatively low, organic fluids can be considered appropriate for vehicle RC application. Wang et al. studied the RC system with nine different pure organic working fluids for engine waste heat recovery. The results indicated that R11, R141b, R113 and R123 presented slightly higher thermodynamic performances while R245fa and R245ca are the most envrionmentfriendly working fluids for engine waste heat revocery applications.

The dry/isentropic organic fluids have a few shortcomings. First, the intrisic property of dry/isentropic fluids reduce the area of net work in the T-s diagram, which means less power output compared to wet fluid, e.g. water. Second, to reduce the cooling load of the condenser, a recuperator (liquid-gas heat exchagner) is usually necessary to cool the superheated vapor to saturated state, which increases the system complexity and cost. Besides, most organic fluids have relatively low thermal instability temperatures compared to water, therefore at high temperature and pressure, the system might suffer chemical decomposition and deterioration. In addition, the current generation of refrigerants, e.g. HFCs (hydroflurocarbons), has a high global warming potential, which means that their use could be limited or banned in the near future. 

Results show that R123 and R245fa present the best thermodynamic performance (the highest thermal efficiency and maximum net power output per unit mass flow rate of exhaust gas) as well as the best economical efficiency (the lowest electricity production cost and minimum ratio of total heat transfer area to net power output).

The main differences between the two working fluids are:
- Due to the differences in the properties such as convective heat transfer coefficient and specific heat capacity, R245fa absorbs more heat at all the conditions and obtains higher potential to output power at light-and-medium duty, while R123 only has similar power output ability at heavy duty. However, consid- ering the limited cooling capacity on-board, R123 shows advantage at heavy duty, since it absorbs less heat therefore requires less cooling.
- The expander designed for R245fa works well at varying con- ditions since R245fa has a smaller variation range of expansion ratio, while the expander designed for R123 is more suitable for steady conditions.
- Considering the conclusions above and different decomposition temperature, R123 suits better when ORC is designed for long- haul heavy-duty truck, while R245fa is more suitable for city bus.
- Imposing the efficiency of expander by the data in literature, the thermal efficiency of the system which combined original en- gine and OS/ORC using R123 can reach close to 45% at some working conditions. The average fuel consumption improve- ment of the whole conditions over the original is 2.52% aver- agely, while the maximum improvement as much as 2.8%.
- The improvement of thermal efficiency and fuel consumption brought by OS/ORC system to the original engine is not as obvious as expected, since the heat absorption capacity of OS/ ORC is not sufficient enough in the heavy duty conditions. The heat exchange capacity of evaporator, the charge capacity of organic fluid and the cooling capacity of refrigerating unit all require further adaptation.

** ICWHR
The ICWHR Cycle Differs From The Rankine cycle in that *an energy conversion subsystem is not necessary* since the recovered energy is sent back to the combustion chamber directly, and then the system efficiency is improved significantly. Furthermore, the theoretical results indicate that the full cycle efficiency of ICWHR system is determined by the regeneration effectiveness, the compression ratio and the fuel equivalence ratio, then *the limitations of Rankine cycle, such as working fluid selection and system parameter calibration can be avoided mechanically.*

The review indicated that traditional approaches have a common feature when they are applied for IC engine waste heat recovery in that an additional energy conversion facility, such as a turbine, an expander or a thermo-electric generator is normally to convert the thermal energy into the dynamic energy or electricity. Such a feature leads to a poor efficiency when applied on IC engines. For example, Organic Rankine Cycle, which has been proven to be one of the most effective solutions for engine waste heat recovery, will only provide a 3–6% engine efficiency improvement on a practical heavy duty diesel engine. Directly recovering the thermal energy back into the internal combustion engine cycle, such as in a recuperated Brayton cycle, will potentially offer a higher thermal efficiency and a simpler system. *Isothermal compression* has the potential to reduce the after compression temperature of the working fluid. By injecting the coolant media (such as liquid nitrogen or water) into the working fluid, the temperature of the compressed working fluid can be decreased significantly, much lower than the after-expansion temperature of the working fluid. Accordingly, *the amount of the recuperated heat will increase.*

*** Isothermal compression
Compared to conventional engines, the *compression work can be significantly reduced* through the injection of a controlled quantity of water in the compression cylinder, lowering the gas temperature during compression. 

| Pressure Ratio | Ideal work savings |
|----------------+--------------------|
|             10 |                29% |
|             15 |                34% |
|             20 |                37% |
|             25 |                39% |
|             30 |                41% |

Main advantages of the splitting of the compression and expansion strokes into separate cylinders are:
- reduction of the compression work by induction into a cool cylinder or direct cooling of the charge air during compression;
- decoupling of the compression and expansion strokes effectively enabling a Miller cycle;
- high pressure waste heat recovery between the compression and combustion cylinders.

Typically the amount of water injected is about three times the amount of air being compressed. There is* no loss of water by evaporation* since saturation is reached with a low water vapour mass fraction at low temperatures and high pressures. A high-pressure two-phase water/air mixture leaves the isothermal compressor at the end of each compression stroke. The phases are separated and the liquid water phase is cooled and re-injected. *Commercial water separators can quite easily achieve 99% separation efficiencies.* The isothermal compressor does not consume water, but some water is lost through the injection into the low temperature heat exchangers. The make-up water needs to be de-ionised to avoid corrosion and the formation of deposits, however the economic (and environmental) effects ofthis water consumption are small.

*** Cycle configuration

Through a split cycle engine structure design, *the compression and expansion processes are conducted in separate chambers*, and then a heat recuperation is achieved through a recuperator installed between the two chambers. There may be more cylinders for the combustion that cylinders for the compression. Due to the isothermal compression of the charge air, the temperature difference between the compression and expansion chamber is enlarged. Consequently, a significant engine efficiency improvement is achieved.

This configuration has the potential to greatly improve the overall cycle efficiency.

*** Advantages in WHR
In a traditional recuperative system, the acquired power from the waste heat is decided by: the heat recuperating efficiency of the heat exchanger efficiency and the energy converting efficiency of the Rankine cycle efficiency. However, the engine with ICWHR system has separate compression and combustion cylinders. Through a recuperator between the two chambers, waste heat can be recovered and transferred back to the combustion cylinder directly. Quasi-isothermal compression of the charge air in the compression cylinder increases the temperature difference between the compression cylinder discharge and exhaust gas. Exhaust heat is therefore more effectively recovered within the cycle.
 
For the split cycle engine, the working fluid is the compressed intake air in the recuperator, thus the intake air mass flow rate and the heat recuperation performance will vary under different engine operating conditions. The one dimensional temperature distributions of the exhaust flow and the intake air in the recuperator calculated for the split cycle engine. It can be seen that the exhaust temperature increases when a lower compression ratio (CR) is applied. However, the corresponding temperature increase of the intake air is not as high as for the exhaust temperature. The modeling results show *that the exhaust/intake air temperature difference is increased under low CR conditions, and then the recuperation performance becomes poorer accordingly.*

Isothermal compression can yield significant savings in compression work compared to the adiabatic (isentropic) compression, where more work is needed to compress the hotter gas. The effect of the injection of water into the compressor chamber, for a 350 K intake air temperature and 2 bar initial pressure is shown in Fig. 6. The adiabatic case results in a 92 bar final pressure at the position of EVO for a CR of 18. When a 20 g/s water injection applied, the compression pressure is significantly decreased for the same compression ratio. When the CR value is increased to 31.5, the same final pressure is achieved as the adiabatic case, providing equivalent combustor inlet pressure. Since the compression stroke length is fixed, the compression work is decided by the in-cylinder pressure during the compression. Compared to the pressure curve of the adiabatic compression case, the pressure is decreased when water injection is applied. The water injection therefore reduces both the compression temperature and the consumed work on the split cycle engine. *For an 80 g/s water injection rate, 15.7% of the compression work can be saved with a CR value of 22. However, the percentage does not increase significantly when the injection rate is higher than 40 g/s.* The effect of the water injection rate on the in-cylinder temperature can be seen in Fig. 7(b), a significant decrease is observed even when the water injection is as low as 5 g/s. With a CR value of 18, the compressed air temperature is as low as 380 K for a 37 g/s of water injection, only slightly higher than the 350 K intake temperature. *The water injection rate should therefore be calibrated carefully to achieve quasi-isothermal compression to avoid excessive water injection and associated parasitic losses.*

This can be used in a hybrid cycle as an energy storage device for regenerative braking for high efficiency mode (vedi video) and cruising mode.

*The reduced air temperature at the intake of the power cycle allows to boost at higher pressure when still avoiding knocking. This allows to achieve more power production and an higher torque, diesel like.*

*** Comparison

The heat recuperating efficiency of the evaporator for combined cycle can be slightly higher than that of the recuperator for split cycle engine given the same exhaust flow conditions. According to the Carnot cycle based thermal efficiency analysis mentioned above, it can be calculated that the energy conversion efficiency of combined cycle is 12.1% which is much lower than the case on split cycle engine. On split cycle engine, the combustion occurs in the combustion cylinder chamber. The combustion process for the split cycle engine can be treated as near isobaric.  After the heat recuperation, the heated intake air was induced into the combustion chamber close to top dead center. As a result, a sharp pressure rise can be seen when the intake valve is open, and the pressure fluctuations can be observed as well due to the high intake velocity. *Due to the air induction process, the fuel injection timing on the split cycle engine is slightly delayed comparing to the diesel engine. Correspondingly, a nearly isobaric combustion process appears on this engine.* Due to the isothermal compression, it can be seen that the intake temperature of the split cycle engine is lower than the diesel case at the TDC position even if it is heated by the exhaust gas in the recuperator. So the in-cylinder combustion temperature will be lower than the diesel case as well. *Such a low in-cylinder temperature leads to a low heat transfer losses in the combustion chamber.* Since the isothermal compression is achieved by the water pumping and injection system, a 3.2 kW extra power in consumed in this system, which leads to a 0.8% thermal efficiency losses.

*Comparing to the original diesel engine with an indicated thermal efficiency of 40.4%, the gth of combined cycle is increased to 44.2%, which demonstrate a 3.8% efficiency improvement through the Rankine cycle based WHR system (combined cycle). However, the split cycle based intra-cycle WHR method yielding a system thermal efficiency of 52.2%, which is much higher than that of the combined cycle.*

**** Major findings:
The theoretical analysis indicate that the upper limits of efficiency of both the split cycle and combined cycle are about 20% higher than the conventional diesel cycle. The overall efficiency of split cycle is slightly higher comparing to that of combined cycle, especially under low compression ratio conditions.

Due to the large evaporation latent heat and heat capacity of water/ethanol mixture, the maximum working fluid temperature of the combined cycle is much lower comparing to that on split cycle engine. However, the heat recuperating efficiency of combined cycle is 5% higher than that of the split cycle when the exhaust temperature Texh is 949 K (CR = 17). These two values get closer when T_exh decreases.

To guarantee the working fluid keeps in gas phase after the expansion process in the turbine, and to reduce the waste recovery system cost, the working fluid temperature is cooled down to 365 K for combined cycle case, which is much higher than that in split cycle. According to the Carnot cycle based thermal efficiency analysis, the energy conversion efficiency of the combined cycle is 12.1%, which is much lower than the case of the split cycle engine.

Due to the isothermal compression, the intake temperature of a split cycle engine is lower than the original diesel engine even it is heated by the exhaust gas in the recuperator. So the in-cylinder combustion temperature will be lower than the diesel case as well. Such a low in-cylinder temperature leads to a low heat transfer losses during the combustion process.
 
Based on the above analysis of the heat recuperation process and engine combustion process, the system efficiencies of the combined cycle and the split cycle are achieved. The indicated thermal efficiency gth of combined cycle is increased to 44.2%, which demonstrate a 3.8% efficiency improvement comparing to the original diesel cycle. However, the split cycle based intra-cycle WHR method yielding a system thermal efficiency of 52.2%, which is much higher than that of the combined cycle.

*** Energy flows
*The reason why the isoengine can be more efficient than the Otto or Diesel engine is that much of the thermal energy ofthe exhaust gas and the turbo-charged intake air and virtually all heat from the cooling water can be reintegrated into the process, while the amount of energy rejected to the environment is reduced*. The amount of thermal energy added to the combustors with the preheated air is about twice as much as the mechanical energy added to the air during isothermal compression.

#+CAPTION: SAnkey diagram of the energy flows in the ICWHR

Of particular significance is the discrepancy of energy and exergy content of the air after the isothermal compressor at station 8. While the energy of the cold compressed air is relatively small (324 kW), its exergy (i.e. energy that could be converted into electrical power in an ideal device) is 2.7 MW. Since the temperature is still close to ambient, the compressed air flow can make use of heat available from various sources within the engine. By the time the air flows fully preheated into the power cylinders, it represents an exergy flow of 5.3 MW.

#+CAPTION: Temperature, entropy-diagram for the isoengine cycle and a modern gas turbine cycle
[[./img/comparison.jpg]]

By comparison of the exhaust temperatures for both cycles the T,s-diagram indicates that the specific energy lost with the exhaust gas of the isoengine is much lower than that of the gas turbine. This effect is even more significant when considering the exergy loss with the exhaust gas. The average temperature of heat rejection from the cycle can be calculated by integrating the incremental heat rejected times the temperature for the exhaust gas, the isothermal compressor and the air pre-cooler, then dividing by the total heat rejected. This method, which allows for the latent heat of the water vapour, indicates an overall average heat rejection temperature of 340 K.

*The data provided yield an exergetic efficiency of over 80% for the power cylinders, i.e. the combustion is far less irreversible than in conventional systems.*

*Some thermodynamic cycles can achieve high efficiency only if specific work is sacrificed. This is not the case with the isoengine since the graph shows a substantially greater area of the isoengine cycle on the T,s graph than the gas turbine cycle, indicating a much higher specific work. *

*Some experiments have been performed during the Proof-of-Concept phase, which suggest that the isobaric combustion process ofthe isoengine will give lower NOx emissions than reciprocating diesel and gas engines, in which there is a substantial pressure rise during combustion. The presence of additional water vapour will also assist in the reduction of NOx in the isoengine.*

** Brayton cycle
Researchers claim that an sCO2 power cycle could potentially exhibit a higher thermal efficiency than steam cycles when operating between the same maximum and minimum cycle temperatures. In addition, the high energy density of sCO2 suggests that the size requirements for the turbomachinery used in an sCO2 power cycle could potentially be much lower than those used in steam cycle generation, which may result in lower capital costs. To date, most research in the field has been dedicated to the use of sCO2 as the primary power cycle in nuclear applications, but relatively little research has been aimed toward developing an sCO2 cycle that is well-suited to bottoming cycle applications. The three widely used Brayton cycles turned out to be unsuitable for a bottoming cycle application, and were scrapped. At this point, the project scope evolved to include designing and modeling new potential cycle configurations, with the goal of creating a new cycle configuration that maximizes both efficiency and waste heat recovery. In all, nearly thirty different cycle configurations were conceived of, modeled, and evaluated. While most of these cycles turned out to be unsuitable for further development, three of the modeled cycles showed enough potential to be included.

| Cycle                                | Efficiency |
|--------------------------------------+------------|
| Simple Recuperated Cycle             |      40.3% |
| Recuperated cycle with recompression |      45.5% |
| Recompression and Reheat cycle       |      49.3% |

After modeling the three proposed cycles, the results seemed to agree with claims that an sCO2 Brayton cycle may have slightly higher thermal efficiency than a Rankine steam cycle operating under the same maximum and minimum temperature. However, new information soon came into light, and additional considerations had to be taken into account.

A distinction needs to be made between two different heat sources that are commonly encountered within the power generation industry. A heat flux source is one in which heat is not limited by temperature reduction. A good example of a heat flux source is a nuclear reaction. A nuclear power source will produce a constant heat flux regardless of the temperature in which the heat is being transferred. In contrast, a sensible heat source is one in which the heat available is heavily dependent on the temperature. A good example of a sensible heat source is the exhaust from a combustion cycle. *The commonly proposed cycles shown above are well suited to operating with a heat flux producing power source, but are not well suited to a sensible heat source, such as topping cycle exhaust.*

To put it another way, a bottoming cycle may have a thermal efficiency of 50%, but if only 100 MW of heat is supplied to the system, the cycle will only produce 50 MW of usable power. On the other hand, another power cycle might have a thermal efficiency of only 30%, but if it can recover 300 MW of heat from the exhaust, it will produce 90 MW of usable power, nearly double the power of the first cycle. So, while thermal efficiency is certainly an important quality of any power cycle, *a high cycle efficiency does not necessarily correlate with a high power output when used with a sensible heat source*. A truly effective bottoming cycle would be one in which thermal efficiency is balanced with the ability to recover waste heat.

A major disadvantage of the solar thermal Brayton cycle is the high receiver operating temperatures required to get reasonable efficiencies. Most Brayton cycles are not self-sustaining at operating temperatures below 480 °C.

It's possible to use some objective functions expressing the entropy generation in order to minimize it and, then, achieve the best efficiency and energy production.
On the other hand, none of the cycles modeled for the high temperature, high power H Class application exceeded the power output of its current steam cycle.


* System integration
To utilize the waste heat from vehicles via Rankine cycle system, a best compromise between the system complexity and fuel saving potential needs to be found out. Regarding vehicle integration, it is widely acknowledged that how to minimize the system complexity, weight, costs and the negative effect on the existing components is more important than maximizing the RC power output.

** Influence of the added weight
An increased vehicle weight cannot be avoided due to extra system components, which would lead to more tractive effort required to accelerate the vehicle and more rolling resistance from the tires. It is roughly estimated that for every 100 pounds added to the vehicle, the fuel economy is decreased by 1-2 percent. For small passenger vehicles, the added-on weight has more impact to the fuel economy than it does on the long-haul diesel truck.

** Influence of the added machinery/hardware
A heat exchanger is necessary to transmit the heat from exhaust gas to working fluid of the RC system at excellent efficiency, which will increase the engine back pressure and affect the engine performance, followed by a large horsepower loss. Therefore the overall added exhaust back pressure should be limited to avoid big engine performance deterioration. On the other hand, the evaporator lowers the exhaust gas temperature, which decreases the exhaust gas velocity and thus a smaller pressure loss through the piping and components following the evaporator. Both effects should be considered when the engine back pressure increment is calculated. Boretti claimed that turbocharged engines may better work with an increased back pressure than naturally aspirated engines.

The heat coming from the RC condenser needs to be dissipated to the environment, which increases the cooling demand of the vehicles. There are basically two ways to condense the RC work fluid, a separate air-cooled condenser and integrating into the existing engine cooling loop. The downside of this integration strategy is that the engine coolant temperature at the condenser inlet may be too high to completely condense and sub-cool the RC working fluid. Also the available cooling capacity of the radiator may not be enough, which will restrict the condenser heat rejection and thus RC power output. In addition, additional heat transferred to the engine cooling loop requires a coolant circulation at higher speed and higher cooling air velocity, which lead to an increase coolant pump power consumption and increase air flow resistance. On the other hand, keeping the two components separated leads to an increased space needed for installation and increased air resistance.

** How to use the energy produced
Generally there are two ways to use this recovered energy: outputting the mechanical energy directly to the crank shaft and combining the RC system with electrical generators to convert the mechanical energy into electricity. For small passenger vehicles, the driving profile is not stable which leads to a fluctuating exhaust gas temperature, then the second method seems to be a more reasonable option.

** Placement of the WHR system
The performance of NOX after-treatment systems decreases sharply at temperatures below approximately 250°C for lean NOX traps (LNTs) and below approximately 200-250°C for selective catalyst reduction (SCR) systems. For operating points that fall below the red line in Figure 1, the post-turbine exhaust temperature is already below 250°C. For this reason, it seems likely that the after-treatment systems will need to be placed upstream of the waste-heat recovery (WHR) system. Placement of a diesel paniculate filter (DPF) upstream of the WHR system would also reduce heat exchanger fouling. This strategy could also mitigate some of the aftertreatment fuel penalty by recovering some of the energy released by exothermal reactions during catalyst regeneration events. However, high temperatures can also degrade the performance and shorten the life of the aftertreatment systems. Placing the WHR system upstream of the after-treatment system could help regulate the catalyst temperature. This approach could be especially helpful when also employing strategies which limit engine heat loss or increase the operating load of the engine.
